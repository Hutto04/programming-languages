# Project Title: The Scala "Back to the Pet Store" Simulation

## Author: William Hutto

### What I Liked About Using Scala for This Project

1. **Expressiveness**: Scala's blend of functional and object-oriented programming paradigms allowed for expressive code that was both concise and powerful. Writing complex operations in a few lines of code was particularly satisfying.

2. **Immutability and Type Inference**: The ease of working with immutable data structures and the compiler's type inference capabilities made the code safer and reduced the boilerplate, which helped maintain a focus on the simulation logic rather than on managing state or specifying types everywhere.

3. **Pattern Matching**: Scala's pattern matching is robust and versatile. It simplified handling different cases for animal behaviors and staff actions within the pet store simulation, making the code easier to read and manage.

### Challenges I Faced with Scala

1. **Learning Curve**: Scala's rich feature set and its functional programming aspects can be daunting for beginners. The initial learning curve was steep, especially understanding advanced features and best practices.

2. **Compilation Times**: For larger projects, Scala's compilation times can be slow. While not a significant issue for this project, it's something that could impact productivity in larger scale developments.

3. **Tooling and Documentation**: While there are excellent Scala tools and resources available, I sometimes found it challenging to locate up-to-date examples or documentation for specific use cases or less commonly used features.

### Most Important Reference Used

- **Twitter's Scala School**: A comprehensive guide to Scala that helped me grasp both basic and advanced concepts necessary for the project. It was particularly useful for understanding Scala's collection libraries and functional programming aspects.
