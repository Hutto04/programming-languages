# Project Title: Clojure and Haskell Exploration

## Author: William Hutto

### What I Liked About Using Clojure

1. **Concise Syntax**: Clojure's syntax is very concise, which makes the code compact and easier to write once you get the hang of it. 
2. **Immutability by Default**: Makes it easier to reason about code, especially in concurrent applications, as it reduces side effects and state changes.
3. **Rich Standard Library/Tooling**: Clojure's rich set of built-in libraries as well as the REPL and other tools make development efficient and enjoyable.

### What I Disliked About Using Clojure

1. **JVM Startup Time**: The time it takes for the JVM to start can be a bit cumbersome, especially during short iterative development cycles.
2. **Error Messages**: Clojure's error messages can sometimes be hard to decipher, which can make debugging more difficult than necessary.
3. **Less Intuitive for Beginners**: The Lisp syntax (lots of parentheses) takes some time to get used to.

### What I Liked About Using Haskell

1. **Strong Static Type System**: Haskell's type system is robust and catches many errors at compile time.
2. **Pure Functions**: All functions in Haskell are pure by default, which makes debugging easier.
3. **Lazy Evaluation**: This feature allows defining complex structures without worrying about their computational cost unless they are actually used, which can lead to performance improvements.

### What I Disliked About Using Haskell

1. **Steep Learning Curve**: Haskell's concepts like monads and functors can be abstract and challenging to grasp at first.
2. **Library Ecosystem**: While growing, Haskell's library ecosystem is not as rich or mature as those available in more mainstream languages.
3. **Compilation Times**: For larger projects, Haskell's compilation times can be lengthy, which might slow down development.
